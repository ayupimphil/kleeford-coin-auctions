      <h2>A trusted family business since 1985</h2>
      <p>Kleeford Coin Auctions is a well-established and well-respected numismatic auction business, specialising in good quality individual items.</p>
      <p>We have been operating since 1985 and, in addition to coins, items we regularly have for sale include medals, banknotes, tokens, small gold and silver items and books. Although we’re based in Derbyshire, our absentee bidding systems means we’re popular with coin dealers across the UK and worldwide.</p>
      <p>Bids can be placed throughout the month. Auctions are held monthly (except in July, August and December). We are well-known for our excellent customer service and friendly advice. If you’re looking to buy or sell items, contact us today.</p>
